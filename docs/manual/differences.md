# Differences

All notable differences between the default Helix Framework and the Minerva edited version will be documented in this file.

## Rank System
A fully integrated rank system has been added to the Minerva version of Helix. This system is merely a copy of the default class system from the Framework.

## Reworked Animation System
The animation system has been reworked to allow for more flexibility and customization. It fixes the most popular errors from the default Framework such as the "penguin" Overwatch Soldier models, or some animations that use strings instead of enums not properly working as intended.

## Developer Friendly
The Minerva version of Helix is more developer-friendly than the default Framework. It includes more comments, better documentation, and more examples to help developers understand how to create plugins and modify their Schemas.

Most notable changes include:
```
|-- More detailed documentation for the following features:
|   |-- Creating a Plugin
|   |-- Creating a Schema
|   |-- Creating a Faction
|   |-- Creating a Class
|   |-- Creating a Rank
|   |-- Creating a Item
|-- Expanded utility library
|-- Proper bot support
```
